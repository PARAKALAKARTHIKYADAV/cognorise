****TASK 1 ; Tic Tac Toe AI**


****Overview****
This project implements a playable Tic Tac Toe game featuring an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI is designed to play optimally, providing a challenging and engaging gameplay experience for players. The implementation is done in Python, making it easy to understand and extend.

**
**Introduction****
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project enhances the traditional game by introducing an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.


****Features**
**
Playable Tic Tac Toe game against an AI opponent

AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal play

Easy-to-understand Python codebase

Command-line interface for simple interaction

Extensible code structure for further enhancements



****Technologies Used**
**
Python 3.x


****Prerequisites****
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your machine

Basic understanding of Python programming


****How the Minimax Algorithm Works****
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.

Maximizing Player (AI): Tries to maximize the score.

Minimizing Player (Human): Tries to minimize the score.

The algorithm recursively explores all possible moves, evaluates them, and assigns scores based on the game outcome:
Win: +1
Loss: -1
Draw: 0

The AI then selects the move with the highest score to ensure optimal play.
